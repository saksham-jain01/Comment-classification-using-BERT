User Manual (Ubuntu):-

First, setup the system using the installation manual.
Your work directory should look like this:

- bert
- bert_output # will appear after training the model
- cased_L-12_H-768_A-12
- dataset
- flask
- get-train.py
- infer-from-json.py
- prediction.py
- request.py
- run-to-train.py

1. In the "dataset" directory, save the comments and their associated numeric labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive, 2 for neutral) as 'combinedaug.csv' with two columns only, i.e. 'comment' and 'label'. There should not be an index.

2. Activate the virtual environment (/venv) if you chose to install tensorflow in it. 

3. Change to the work directory 

4. Run get-train.py to get training dataset in the form usable by BERT

5. Run run-to-train.py to train the model on the training data

6. Modify infer-from-json.py with the server address to which the post requests will be made.

7. After training, run infer-from-json.py

8. Make post request with the comment to be classified.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that that the json post request is of the format json={"text": "the comment here",}
